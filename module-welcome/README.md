# Welcome Channel Module

This module allows you to easily maintain and update a bot-managed channel (for example, a welcome or rules channel) based on a YAML file that you change whenever you need to update it. It also supports dynamic blocks with content that can change over time, and will attempt to only update messages that have not changed.
