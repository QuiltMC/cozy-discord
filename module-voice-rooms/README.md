# Voice Rooms Module

This module is intended to be used by KordEx-based bots that want to provide automated management of voice channels
for users on Discord servers, creating, archiving and deleting them on demand and allowing users to manage their own
channels.

This module is currently a work-in-progress. Documentation will come later.
