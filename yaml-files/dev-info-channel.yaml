          Welcome to the Quilt Development channels - in this category, you'll find channels representing each of Quilt's
          development teams, each containing discussions relevant to their respective projects.


          Unlike a lot of other channels here, **these channels are strictly on-topic.** Please avoid any off-topic
          tangents, and don't be too surprised if you're asked to move to another channel when things stray too far
          from the topic.

          This channel category is set up somewhat differently to the rest of the server. Specifically, take note of the
          following:


          - <#1103979229881831444> may be used for general project-related discussions, and to ask which channel is best
          for a given project or subject

          - <#1103979333627936818> contains individual development logs, split into a forum post per team - these logs
          are automatically copied to <#908399987099045999> by Cozy

          - <#1104421317731688609> contains the git logs - you can look at the channel itself to see all of them, or you
          can look through the threads to find git logs for specific teams

          - The forum channels set up for each team (other than <#1104037919792054282>) are curated by the development
          teams they were created for - users may not create posts, but you can always ask a developer or moderator to
          create a post that you feel should be there

          If you'd like to contribute to Quilt and its projects, we recommend the following:


          - Head to <#1103979229881831444>, or the relevant forum post or channel, and ask whether there's anything
          that needs to be done or any projects that need contributors

          - Go to the relevant project [on our GitHub](https://github.com/QuiltMC) and see whether there are any
          available issues that you could handle - and remember to leave a comment if you're working on an issue

          - Listen in on our monthly developer meetings, where we often discuss the projects that need contributors

          - Take a look at the
          [pending RFC pull requests](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
          and provide some reviews

          - Consider donating to [our OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/quiltmc) to help with Quilt's upkeep
          costs


          Please note that **you do not need to join a team to contribute.** In fact, we encourage you to claim issues
          and submit pull requests externally, especially if you don't wish to handle project management tasks. While
          we are happy to accept applications from regular contributors that wish to join a team, please note that
          this is only necessary if you wish to help out with our project management work - and you shouldn't apply to
          join a team just for a role icon or a name on our site.
