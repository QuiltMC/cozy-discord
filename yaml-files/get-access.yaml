        If you can see this channel, you're likely new to our community. **Welcome!**


        There are many other channels available to verified users. To gain access to them, you'll need to verify
        yourself by passing our member screening process. We require all users to go through this process, as our
        community contains many members that belong to vulnerable minority groups, and we're subject to a lot of
        harassment by those that would seek to harm them.


        Firstly, you should read over our rules, which you'll find in <#817583713423982664>. **By submitting an
        application, you're stating that you understand and agree to our rules.** We will not accept ignorance of our
        rules as an excuse for breaking them.

    - title: Getting Started

        To get started (if you haven't done so already), you'll need to answer some questions. Click/tap on the
        **Continue** button you'll see at the bottom of this channel, and you'll be given a form to fill out. When
        doing so, please bear the following points in mind:


        **»** Detailed answers are more likely to get you accepted than minimum-effort answers

        **»** If you're referring to a YouTube video, website or similar in your answers, please link it if possible

        **»** If someone else referred you to the server, please let us know who it was


        Once you've filled out the form, all you need to do is sit back and relax, and we'll respond to it as soon as
        we can. Please remember that everyone on our Community Team is a volunteer, so it's unlikely that you'll be
        verified immediately - but we try to get through our applications as quickly as we can.

        not to be used to badger us about your application** - we'll get to it when we can!
