    - title: Welcome to The Quilt Toolchain

      description: >
        Welcome to The Quilt Toolchain, the official development Discord server for The Quilt Project.


        The Quilt Project is an open-source, community-driven modding toolchain designed primarily for Minecraft.
        By focusing on speed, ease of use and modularity, Quilt aims to provide a sleek and modern modding toolchain
        with an open ecosystem.


        Quilt is a project that was born out of a need for change in the Minecraft modding ecosystem. Our teams contain
        many experienced members of the modding community, providing a level of familiarity that helps us to avoid the
        mistakes of the past – whether those mistakes relate to community management, diversity and inclusivity, project
        governance or transparency. For more information on how we hope to do this,
        [please see our "about" pages](https://quiltmc.org/about/).


        Before you get started, **please make sure to review our [rules](https://quiltmc.org/community) and
        [Code of Conduct](https://quiltmc.org/community/code-of-conduct).** We also recommend taking a look at our
        [guide for newcomers](https://quiltmc.org/about/newcomer-guide/).


        We hope you enjoy your time with us!

  rules:
    Follow Quilt's Code of Conduct: >
      Everyone is expected to read and abide by our [Code of Conduct](http://quiltmc.org/community/code-of-conduct)

    Follow Discord's rules: >
      As a Discord-based community, we require everyone to follow Discord's
      [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)

    Try to speak English: >
      The common language in our community is English, but we understand that not everyone speaks English at the same
      level. Try to speak English to the best of your ability, and don't worry if you need to use translation tools. We
      will not tolerate making fun of people for poor English.

    Listen to & respect all community team members: >
      Please take requests from community team members seriously and listen when a team member asks you to do
      something. If you have a problem with what a team member is asking you to do, we advise that you step away from
      the situation and send a private message to another team member.

    Keep all projects legal, legitimate & appropriate: >
      We will not tolerate any projects that may break laws, breach a Terms of Service or an EULA, involve sexual
      content, or that the moderators determine to be malicious or inappropriate.

    Don’t spam: >
      Don't spam our channels or users, and don't advertise your projects outside of the relevant showcase channels.

    Respect our channels: >
      Follow the given channel topic, and don't derail a discussion

    When requesting help, specify your mappings: >
      You must help us to help you, and it's important that you include as much information as you can with your help
      request. We also recommend creating a thread for your help request, with your mappings in the thread name
      (`MCP`, `MM`, `YM` or `QM`).

    Don't import drama or controversy from other communities: >
      One of our most important rules - don't make things difficult for other users by bringing up controversies from
      other communities.

      description: >
        Sometimes, something begins trending or becoming popular, or an event happens in the community. We try to
        allow for discussions to happen, but that isn't always possible. For that reason, we ask that you **do not post
        or talk about the following things:**


        **»** AI-generated "body horror" images - generated images of people, animals or faces that are disfigured or
        look "wrong" in any way.


        **»** Anything relating to Mojang's new Java Edition chat reporting features, including discussions relating to
        potential exploits, or mods that make use of them. As an exception to this rule, you may discuss strategies
        and mods for mitigating the usage of exploits on your servers, and good-faith mods that allow you to control
        how chat reporting works on your servers.


        This list will change over time, and we're equally likely to add or remove things as the way people approach
        these subjects online changes.

        This isn't our only social space - we believe that Discord isn't the best platform for long-form
        discussions, and that important information should be available to people that aren't here.


        If you're interested in long-form discussions, development help, news or community project, please feel free
        to join our forum at [https://forum.quiltmc.org](https://forum.quiltmc.org)!
